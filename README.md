# üõí Retail Sales Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project  

## üìå Problem Statement  
Retail businesses collect huge amounts of transactional data daily.  
But the raw data often has:  
- Null or missing values  
- Wrong column names (e.g., `quantiy` instead of `quantity`)  
- Time formats not ready for analysis  

This makes it hard to analyze sales, customers, and product trends.

## üîé Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì fixed column names, removed nulls, formatted time.  
2. **Exploration** ‚Äì counted total sales, customers, categories.  
3. **Analysis** ‚Äì solved key business problems using SQL.  
4. **Insights** ‚Äì generated solutions for management decisions.
